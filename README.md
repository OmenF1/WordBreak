# WordBreak
Basic wordle type breaker.  Lots of room for improvement, especially in word weighting, but this was just for a bit of evening fun.

Most words are guessed correctly within the given limitations of Wordle when only the answer list taken from Wordle is being used, naturally the success rate does drop when using both of their lists (the answers lists and accepted words list) however that's not surprsing considering how simple my word weighting is.
